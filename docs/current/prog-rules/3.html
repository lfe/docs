    <h1>LFE Programming Rules and Conventions</h1>

<h2>3 SW Engineering Principles</h2>

<h3>3.1 Export as few functions as possible from a module</h3>

<p>Modules are the basic code structuring entity in LFE. A module can contain a
large number of functions but only functions which are included in the export
list of the module can be called from outside the module.</p>

<p>Seen from the outside, the complexity of a module depends upon the number of
functions which are exported from the module. A module which exports one or
two functions is usually easier to understand than a module which exports
dozens of functions.</p>

<p>Modules where the ratio of exported/non-exported functions is low are
desirable in that a user of the module only needs to understand the
functionality of the functions which are exported from the module.</p>

<p>In addition, the writer or maintainer of the code in the module can change
the internal structure of the module in any appropriate manner provided the
external interface remains unchanged.</p>

<h3>3.2 Try to reduce intermodule dependencies</h3>

<p>A module which calls functions in many different modules will be more
difficult to maintain than a module which only calls functions in a few
different modules.</p>

<p>This is because each time we make a change to a module interface, we have to
check all places in the code where this module is called. Reducing the
interdependencies between modules simplifies the problem of maintaining these
modules.</p>

<p>We can simplify the system structure by reducing the number of different
modules which are called from a given module.</p>

<p>Note also that it is desirable that the inter-module calling dependencies
form a tree and not a cyclic graph. Example:</p>

<p><img src="/prog-rules/images/module-dep-ok.gif" /></p>

<p>But not</p>

<p><img src="/prog-rules/images/module-dep-bad.gif" /></p>

<h3>3.3 Put commonly used code into libraries</h3>

<p>Commonly used code should be placed into libraries. The libraries should be
collections of related functions. Great effort should be made in ensuring
that libraries contain functions of the same type. Thus a library such as
<code>lists</code> containing only functions for manipulating lists is a good choice,
whereas a library, <code>lists-and-maths</code> containing a combination of functions
for manipulating lists and for mathematics is a very bad choice.</p>

<p>The best library functions have no side effects. Libraries with functions
with side effects limit the re-usability.</p>

<h3>3.4 Isolate &quot;tricky&quot; or &quot;dirty&quot; code into separate modules</h3>

<p>Often a problem can be solved by using a mixture of clean and dirty code.
Separate the clean and dirty code into separate modules.</p>

<p>Dirty code is code that does dirty things. Example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Uses the process dictionary.</li>
<li>Uses <code>(erlang:process_info arg)</code> for strange purposes.</li>
<li>Does anything that you are not supposed to do (but have to do).</li>
</ul>

<p>Concentrate on trying to maximize the amount of clean code and minimize the
amount of dirty code. Isolate the dirty code and clearly comment or otherwise
document all side effects and problems associated with this part of the code.</p>

<h3>3.5 Don&#39;t make assumptions about what the caller will do with the results of a function</h3>

<p>Don&#39;t make assumptions about why a function has been called or about what the
caller of a function wishes to do with the results.</p>

<p>For example, suppose we call a routine with certain arguments which may be
invalid. The implementer of the routine should not make any assumptions about
what the caller of the function wishes to happen when the arguments are
invalid.</p>

<p>Thus we should not write code like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">do-something</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">args</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">case</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">check-args</span> <span class="nv">args</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">&#39;ok</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">tuple</span> <span class="ss">&#39;ok</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">do-it</span> <span class="nv">args</span><span class="p">)))</span>
    <span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">tuple</span> <span class="nb">error</span> <span class="nv">what</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="nb">string</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">format-the-error</span> <span class="nv">what</span><span class="p">)))</span>
        <span class="c1">;; don&#39;t do the following!</span>
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">io:format</span> <span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="s">&quot;* error: ~s~n&quot;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">list</span> <span class="nb">string</span><span class="p">))</span>
        <span class="nb">error</span><span class="p">))))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Instead write something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">do-something</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">args</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">case</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">check-args</span> <span class="nv">args</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">&#39;ok</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">tuple</span> <span class="ss">&#39;ok</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">do-it</span> <span class="nv">args</span><span class="p">)))</span>
    <span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">tuple</span> <span class="nb">error</span> <span class="nv">what</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">tuple</span> <span class="ss">&#39;error</span> <span class="nv">what</span><span class="p">))))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">error-report</span>
  <span class="p">(((</span><span class="nv">tuple</span> <span class="nb">error</span> <span class="nv">what</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">format-the-error</span> <span class="nv">what</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In the former case, the error string is always printed on standard output; in
the latter case, an error descriptor is returned to the application. The
application can now decide what to do with this error descriptor.</p>

<p>By calling <code>error_report/1</code> the application can convert the error
descriptor to a printable string and print it if so required. But this may
not be the desired behavior - in any case the decision as to what to do with
the result is left to the caller.</p>

<h3>3.6 Abstract out common patterns of code or behavior</h3>

<p>Whenever you have the same pattern of code in two or more places in the code
try to isolate this in a common function and call this function instead of
having the code in two different places. Copied code requires much effort to
maintain.</p>

<p>If you see similar patterns of code (i.e. almost identical) in two or more
places in the code it is worth taking some time to see if one cannot change
the problem slightly to make the different cases the same and then write a
small amount of additional code to describe the differences between the two.</p>

<p>Avoid &quot;copy&quot; and &quot;paste&quot; programming, use functions!</p>

<h3>3.7 Top-down</h3>

<p>Write your program using the top-down fashion, not bottom-up (starting with
details). Top-down is a nice way of successively approaching details of the
implementation, ending up with defining primitive functions. The code will be
independent of representation since the representation is not known when the
higher levels of code are designed.</p>

<h3>3.8 Don&#39;t prematurely optimize code</h3>

<p>Don&#39;t optimize your code at the first stage. First make it right, then (if
necessary) make it fast (while keeping it right).</p>

<h3>3.9 Use the principle of &quot;least astonishment&quot;</h3>

<p>The system should always respond in a manner which causes the &quot;least
astonishment&quot; to the user - i.e., a user should be able to predict what will
happen when they do something and not be astonished by the result.</p>

<p>This has to do with consistency. A consistent system where different modules
do things in a similar manner will be much easier to understand than a system
where each module does things in a different manner.</p>

<p>If you get astonished by what a function does, either your function solves
the wrong problem or it has a wrong name.</p>

<h3>3.10 Try to eliminate side effects</h3>

<p>LFE has several primitives which have side effects. One may also call
functions from Erlang/OTP in LFE which have side effects. Functions which use
these cannot be easily re-used since they cause permanent changes to their
environment and you have to know the exact state of the process before
calling such routines.</p>

<p>Write as much as possible of the code with side-effect free code.</p>

<p>Maximize the number of pure functions.</p>

<p>Collect together the functions which have side effect and clearly document
all the side effects.</p>

<p>With a little care most code can be written in a side-effect free manner -
this will make the system a lot easier to maintain, test and understand.</p>

<h3>3.11 Don&#39;t allow private data structure to &quot;leak&quot; out of a module</h3>

<p>This is best illustrated by a simple example. We define a simple module
called queue, to implement queues:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">defmodule</span> <span class="nv">queues1</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">export</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">fetch</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">add</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">item</span> <span class="nv">queue</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">lists:append</span> <span class="nv">queue</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">list</span> <span class="nv">item</span><span class="p">)))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">fetch</span>
  <span class="p">(((</span><span class="nb">cons</span> <span class="nv">head</span> <span class="nv">tail</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">tuple</span> <span class="ss">&#39;ok</span> <span class="nv">head</span> <span class="nv">tail</span><span class="p">))</span>
  <span class="p">((</span><span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">())</span>
    <span class="ss">&#39;empty</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This implements a queue as a list, unfortunately to use this the user must
know that the queue is represented as a list. A typical interactive usage in
the LFE REPL might look like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="nb">&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">c</span> <span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="s">&quot;src/queues1.lfe&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">#(</span><span class="nv">module</span> <span class="nv">queues1</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">set</span> <span class="nv">q1</span> <span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">())</span>
<span class="p">()</span>
<span class="nb">&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">set</span> <span class="nv">q2</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">queues1:add</span> <span class="ss">&#39;joe</span> <span class="nv">q1</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">joe</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">set</span> <span class="nv">q3</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">queues1:add</span> <span class="ss">&#39;mike</span> <span class="nv">q2</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">joe</span> <span class="nv">mike</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is bad since the user:</p>

<ol>
<li>needs to know that the queue is represented as a list, and</li>
<li>the implementer cannot change the internal representation of the queue
(this they might want to do later to provide a better version of the ̇
module).</li>
</ol>

<p>Better is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">defmodule</span> <span class="nv">queues2</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">export</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">fetch</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">new</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">new</span> <span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">())</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">add</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">item</span> <span class="nv">queue</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">lists:append</span> <span class="nv">queue</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">list</span> <span class="nv">item</span><span class="p">)))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">fetch</span>
  <span class="p">(((</span><span class="nb">cons</span> <span class="nv">head</span> <span class="nv">tail</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">tuple</span> <span class="ss">&#39;ok</span> <span class="nv">head</span> <span class="nv">tail</span><span class="p">))</span>
  <span class="p">((</span><span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">())</span>
    <span class="ss">&#39;empty</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can write:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="nb">&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">c</span> <span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="s">&quot;src/queues2.lfe&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">#(</span><span class="nv">module</span> <span class="nv">queues2</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">set</span> <span class="nv">q1</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">queues2:new</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">()</span>
<span class="nb">&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">set</span> <span class="nv">q2</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">queues2:add</span> <span class="ss">&#39;joe</span> <span class="nv">q1</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">joe</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">set</span> <span class="nv">q3</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">queues2:add</span> <span class="ss">&#39;mike</span> <span class="nv">q2</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">joe</span> <span class="nv">mike</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Which is much better and corrects this problem.</p>

<p>Now suppose the user needs to know the length of the queue, they might be
tempted to write:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="nb">&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">set</span> <span class="nv">len</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">length</span> <span class="nv">queue-2</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="c1">; don&#39;t do this!</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>since they know that the queue is represented as a <code>list</code>. Again this is
bad programming practice and leads to code which is very difficult to
maintain and understand. If they need to know the length of the queue then a
<code>len/1</code> function must be added to the module, thus:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">defmodule</span> <span class="nv">queues3</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">export</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">fetch</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">len/1</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">new</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">new</span> <span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">())</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">add</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">item</span> <span class="nv">queue</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">lists:append</span> <span class="nv">queue</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">list</span> <span class="nv">item</span><span class="p">)))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">fetch</span>
  <span class="p">(((</span><span class="nb">cons</span> <span class="nv">head</span> <span class="nv">tail</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">tuple</span> <span class="ss">&#39;ok</span> <span class="nv">head</span> <span class="nv">tail</span><span class="p">))</span>
  <span class="p">((</span><span class="o">&#39;</span><span class="p">())</span>
    <span class="ss">&#39;empty</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">len</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">queue</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">length</span> <span class="nv">queue</span><span class="p">))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now the user can call <code>(queues3:len queue)</code> instead.</p>

<p>Here we say that we have &quot;abstracted out&quot; all the details of the queue (the
queue is in fact what is called an &quot;abstract data type&quot;).</p>

<p>Why do we go to all this trouble? - the practice of abstracting out internal
details of the implementation allows us to change the implementation without
changing the code of the modules which call the functions in the module we
have changed. So, for example, a better implementation of the queue is as
follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">defmodule</span> <span class="nv">queues4</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">export</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">add</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">fetch</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">len</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">new</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">new</span> <span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="o">#(</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">()))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">add</span>
  <span class="s">&quot;Faster addition of elements that using lists:append.&quot;</span>
  <span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">item</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">tuple</span> <span class="nv">x</span> <span class="nv">y</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">tuple</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">cons</span> <span class="nv">item</span> <span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="nv">y</span><span class="p">)))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">fetch</span>
  <span class="p">(((</span><span class="nv">tuple</span> <span class="nv">x</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">cons</span> <span class="nv">head</span> <span class="nv">tail</span><span class="p">)))</span>

<h3>3.12 Make code as deterministic as possible</h3>

<p>A deterministic program is one which will always run in the same manner no
matter how many times the program is run. A non-deterministic program may
deliver different results each time it is run. For debugging purposes it is a
good idea to make things as deterministic as possible. This helps make errors
reproducible.</p>

<p>For example, suppose one process has to start five parallel processes and
then check that they have started correctly, suppose further that the order
in which these five are started does not matter.</p>

<p>We could then choose to either start all five in parallel and then check that
they have all started correctly but it would be better to start them one at a
time and check that each one has started correctly before starting the next
one.</p>

<h3>3.13 Do not program &quot;defensively&quot;</h3>

<p>A defensive program is one where the programmer does not &quot;trust&quot; the input
data to the part of the system they are programming. In general one should
not test input data to functions for correctness. Most of the code in the
system should be written with the assumption that the input data to the
function in question is correct. Only a small part of the code should
actually perform  any checking of the data. This is usually done when data
&quot;enters&quot; the system for the first time, once data has been checked as it
enters the system it should thereafter be assumed correct.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="c1">;; args: option is either &#39;all or &#39;normal</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">get-server-usage-info</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">option</span> <span class="nv">ascii-pid</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">pid</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">list_to_pid</span> <span class="nv">ascii-pid</span><span class="p">)))</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">case</span> <span class="nv">option</span>
      <span class="ss">&#39;all</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">get-all-info</span> <span class="nv">pid</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="ss">&#39;normal</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">get-normal-info</span> <span class="nv">pid</span><span class="p">))))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The function will crash if <code>option</code> is neither <code>&#39;normal</code> nor <code>&#39;all</code>,
and it <em>should</em> do that. The caller is responsible for supplying correct
input.</p>

<h3>3.14 Isolate hardware interfaces with a device driver</h3>

<p>Hardware should be isolated from the system through the use of device
drivers. The device drivers should implement hardware interfaces which make
the hardware appear as if they were Erlang processes. Hardware should be
made to look and behave like normal Erlang processes. Hardware should appear
to receive and send normal Erlang messages and should respond in the
conventional manner when errors occur.</p>

<h3>3.15 Do and undo things in the same function</h3>

<p>Suppose we have a program which opens a file, does something with it and
closes it later. This should be coded as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="c1">;; the followingis good code</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">do-something-with</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">file</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">case</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">file:open</span> <span class="nv">file</span> <span class="ss">&#39;read</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">tuple</span> <span class="ss">&#39;ok</span> <span class="nc">stream</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">do-it</span> <span class="nc">stream</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">file:close</span> <span class="nc">stream</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">error</span> <span class="nb">error</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note the symmetry in opening the file with <code>(file:open ...)</code> and closing
it with <code>(file:close ...)</code> in the same routine.</p>

<p>The solution below is much  harder to follow and it is not obvious which
file that is closed. Don&#39;t program it like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cl" data-lang="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">do-something-with</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">file</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">case</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">file:open</span> <span class="nv">file</span> <span class="ss">&#39;read</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">tuple</span> <span class="ss">&#39;ok</span> <span class="nc">stream</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">do-it</span> <span class="nc">stream</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">error</span> <span class="nb">error</span><span class="p">)))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">do-it</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nc">stream</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="o">...</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">func-234</span> <span class="o">...</span> <span class="nc">stream</span> <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">func-234</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">...</span> <span class="nc">stream</span> <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="o">...</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">file:close</span> <span class="nc">stream</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="c1">; don&#39;t do this!</span>
